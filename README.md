# Alakai

Alakai is a Luau documentation generation tool that's still in development. 

### Release Date

Due to the relatively low importance of Alakai and the limited resources we have at Crescent, this project is expected to at least get released in mid-2025. Do note that this is a guess, and the project could release early as well.
